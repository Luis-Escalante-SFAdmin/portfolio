            Hi, I'm Luis Escalante!
          </h1>
          <p>
            I am currently working as a Salesforce Developer in the Public Sector, where I have had the opportunity to
            work with Flows, Apex and Ligtning Web Components. I am also a freelancer who has worked with companies helping them 
            to implement Salesforce into their business processes, and helping them to solve their pain points by using Sales Cloud or 
            Service Cloud. But also working with Experience Cloud sites.<br><br>
            I have also worked with companies to clean up their codes in the platform or creating new Apex classes, API Integrations or whatever else 
            they need to improve their Salesforce org.<br><br>
            I am currently preparing to take the Platform Develoer II certification exam.

            <h3>Salesforce Implementation ‚òÅÔ∏è</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Performing as a solo Admin, I configured Salesforce (Sales Cloud) for a petroleum company. Where I had the opportunity to build Flows, custom Objects, fields, reports and dashboards, and importing and cleaning data using Data Export Wizard. 
                But also, provided videos to show how users could do those tasks by themselves, and saving thos videos in the Knowledge app.</li><br>
              <li>A second opportunity I had, was for a company focus on selling electronics, and the tasks a had to complete were pretty similr to the one mentioned before, I had the interesting and fun challenge of
              working with Integrations, for platforms like Match My Email and Box.com. And for these companies, the users for Salesforce were around 10 people each.</li> </br>
              <li>Created a org to track job applications where I would create records of the roles applied and created an Account for the company, but also, if I could have the name of the Recruiter and/or Hiring Manager,
                I create a contact record and link them to the job application and to the account.</li></br>
              <li>Currently working in a website (Experience Cloud site) where I provide workouts and also planning on providing recipes to improve our nutrition. Also, de goal for this website is to get experience on building Lightning Web Components,
                and to work on my Apex skills. Soon link will be provided on the top menu!

                <li>This app can be used (for now) in any Discord Server was built mostly for practice and for fun!

            <ul>
              <li>In 2022, I started my first couple of projects as a Salesforce Admin, where the goal it was to implement Saleforce (Sales Cloud) for a couple of businesses that were new into the ecosystem and they wanted to adapt it to theri business process. The main tool used for project management, was Quip, and the main communication app was Slack.</li></br>
              <li>One company was focus in selling petroleum, where the main goal or main pain points they wanted to solve, it was first to adapt the Data model to their needs, where it was needed to create a few customs fields and objects.</li><br>
              <li>Another request that the client was focus, it was on creating the necessary automations, Flows, to optimize and make more efficient the work of their end users. The Flows mainly created where Record-Triggered Flows and Autolaunched Flws.</li> <br>
              <li>The second project I led, was with a company I worked with, it was focus on selling electronics, and the main pain point they wanted to solve, it was to have a better way to track the emails that were sent to their clients, and also to have a better way to store their files. So, I had the opportunity to work with Integrations, for platforms like Match My Email and Box.com.</li>

        <h3>Starting Journey as a Salesforce Developer üöÄ</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>On November of 2022, after having a couple of projects as a Salesforce Admin, I started to pivot to a Salesforce Developer role where I started to take modules and projects in Salesforce Trailhead ‚õ∞Ô∏è to practice Apex, Visualforce pages and Lightning Web Components.</li></br>
          <li>I also took a Front-End development course where the main focus was learning HTML, CSS, Python and JavaScript, which a considered was a good decision to take it since HTML, CSS and JS are the maing languages used to create Lightning Web Components.</li><br>
          <li>Starting 2023, one of the first projects I had to work on, it was to create a website (Experience Cloud site for myself) where I provide workouts and also planning on providing recipes to improve our nutrition. Also, de goal for this website is to get experience on building Lightning Web Components,
            and to work on my Apex skills.</li></br>
          <li>At the same time, I started in a non-profit Salesforce Community as a Salesforce Developer where my main tasks were keep updated the group site (Experience Cloud site) and creating a chatbot ü§ñ which you could input key words and you would a get a response from it,
            which was a fun project to work on. And for some context, this was a community mainly for support for new and no-new Salesforce enthusiasts.</li></br>
          <li>From January 2023 to October 2023, I kept working with independent consultant providing "tech-support" services for their clients, where mainly the projects/tasks where focus on defining for some customer their data modeling in Salesforce, automations to keep communications with their customer or to make
            their employees' work faster and efficient, which, basically the main work was to create Flows.</li>

        <h3>Landing my First FTE Salesforce Developer role üõ¨</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>In October of 2023, I landed my first full time job as a Salesforce Developer with Brooksource, where I have been working directly with the State (Public Sector) and have the opportunity to work with a team of developer, having tasks on cleaning up their backlog. 
            In that backlog there were a mix of tasks, suchs as importing workflows and process builders to Flows, cleaninig up Apex code (classes and test classes), create a Visualforce page (as a test) with a form for constituents to fill out and submit, inserting the persons's record in the database and sending notifications to the employees.
            Created also a Lightning Web Component replacing a standard record page layout but making sure that has the same functionality.</li></br>
          </li></br>
          <li>Currently (December 2024) I have been working with the Lead Developer on learning about their Marketing Cloud, learning on how and when to use Journey Builder, Contact Builder and more. But also, working on understanding how OmniStudio works, how we can implement it for the client's portal where constituents can apply for benefits that the State government provides.</li></br>

        <h3>Freelancer Salesforce Developer üë∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Yes! I also do freelance/contract work. These opportunities, besides the extra income, have allowed me to upskill as well, for example:</li><br>
            <ul>
              <li>Working as a Salesforce Admin/Dev for a contractor, I have had the chance of experience different scenarios, where I have created a bunch of formula fields (no, those are not fun ü§™), Flows to update, create, or relate records between different objects. Create HTTP Callouts in a Flow, update page layouts, create reports and dashboards. Basically, doing more tasks in a declarative way which I do not mind 
                to do since also Admin (and declarative) skills are so important to be a good developer.</li><br>
              <li>With another client I have had the chance on working in a more full-mode developer üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª, where I have been added to their backlog, where mainly there is a big need to update Apex classes and test classes, giving me the opportunity to learn more about Apex, SOQL Queries, and triggers. I have been given tasks to create new API calls from Salesforce to third-party apps 
                that are in charge to send emails, verifications codes, keep customers on track with their payments and providing a platform to be able to manage their finances, helping the to make payments without the need to go to a computer or a store. And the great opportunity also, is that I have been working with their external website by updating and improving the UI, in this case, in WordPress.

            Hi, I'm Luis Escalante!
          </h1>
          <p>
            I am currently working as a Salesforce Developer in the Public Sector, where I have had the opportunity to
            work with Flows, Apex and Ligtning Web Components. I am also a freelancer who has worked with companies helping them 
            to implement Salesforce into their business processes, and helping them to solve their pain points by using Sales Cloud or 
            Service Cloud. But also working with Experience Cloud sites.<br><br>
            I have also worked with companies to clean up their codes in the platform or creating new Apex classes, API Integrations or whatever else 
            they need to improve their Salesforce org.

            <h3>Salesforce Implementation ‚òÅÔ∏è</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Performing as a solo Admin, I configured Salesforce (Sales Cloud) for a petroleum company. Where I had the opportunity to build Flows, custom Objects, fields, reports and dashboards, and importing and cleaning data using Data Export Wizard. 
                But also, provided videos to show how users could do those tasks by themselves, and saving thos videos in the Knowledge app.</li><br>
              <li>A second opportunity I had, was for a company focus on selling electronics, and the tasks a had to complete were pretty similr to the one mentioned before, I had the interesting and fun challenge of
              working with Integrations, for platforms like Match My Email and Box.com. And for these companies, the users for Salesforce were around 10 people each.</li> </br>
              <li>Created a org to track job applications where I would create records of the roles applied and created an Account for the company, but also, if I could have the name of the Recruiter and/or Hiring Manager,
                I create a contact record and link them to the job application and to the account.</li></br>
              <li>Currently working in a website (Experience Cloud site) where I provide workouts and also planning on providing recipes to improve our nutrition. Also, de goal for this website is to get experience on building Lightning Web Components,
                and to work on my Apex skills. Soon link will be provided on the top menu!

                <li>This app can be used (for now) in any Discord Server was built mostly for practice and for fun!

            <h3>Starting as a Salesforce Admin ü§ì</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>In 2022, I started my first couple of projects as a Salesforce Admin, where the goal it was to implement Saleforce (Sales Cloud) for a couple of businesses that were new into the ecosystem and they wanted to adapt it to theri business process. The main tool used for project management, was Quip, and the main communication app was Slack.</li></br>
              <li>One company was focus in selling petroleum, where the main goal or main pain points they wanted to solve, it was first to adapt the Data model to their needs, where it was needed to create a few customs fields and objects.</li><br>
              <li>Another request that the client was focus, it was on creating the necessary automations, Flows, to optimize and make more efficient the work of their end users. The Flows mainly created where Record-Triggered Flows and Autolaunched Flws.</li> <br>
              <li>The second project I led, was with a company I worked with, it was focus on selling electronics, and the main pain point they wanted to solve, it was to have a better way to track the emails that were sent to their clients, and also to have a better way to store their files. So, I had the opportunity to work with Integrations, for platforms like Match My Email and Box.com.</li></br>

        <h3> No More Duplicates ü§Ø</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>First, I had to work on importing a spreadsheet with more than 10,000 records, keeping in mind that I had to remove duplicated but making sure that they had all the necessary information.</li></br>
          <li>Once having records in an org, I had the challenge of also taking care of duplicates, so, the fastest solution was to install an app from AppExchange, free, easy to use and got the solution of merging all duplicated records.</li></br>
